## v0.17.0-rc1

*Oct 15, 2020*

This release is primarily about upgrading for compatibility with 
[Tendermint Core
v0.34](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/UPGRADING.md#v0340)
and the [Cosmos Stargate release](https://stargate.cosmos.network/). 
The heart of that work was replacing amino serialization with Protocol Buffers - 
see the new [proto crate](./proto) for all protobuf files and generated types. 
The protobuf files were duplicated from [Tendermint
Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/v0.34.0-rc5/proto/tendermint).

To improve developer ergonomics and reduce future impact on the codebase from
serialization, the generated protobuf types are not used directly in public
APIs; rather, we introduce the notion of `DomainTypes` for each type to be used
in Rust APIs, and implement conversions to and from the
corresponding generated protobuf type for binary serialization.

Other improvements in this release include a new and improved WebSocket client,
a new light-client initialization API,
and the introduction of Model Based Testing for the light client, which allows
us to automatically generate complex tests for the light client based on a
formal model of the protocol in TLA+.

Since this is a pretty big release with many breaking changes, we currently aim
to ship additional release candidates where the focus will be on additional
testing and greater compatibility with dependent projects.

### BREAKING CHANGES:

- `[rpc]` The RPC client interface has been refactored. The
  `Client` struct is now `HttpClient` and is enabled with the `http-client`
  feature. It provides all RPC endpoints except the subscription related ones.
- `[rpc]` The EventListener was replaced with a new and improved
  WebSocketClient for more robust event subscriptions. It can be enabled with the
  `websocket-client` feature. Subscriptions are exposed using unbounded
  channels. ([#516])
  
- `[tendermint]` Removed all trace of Amino, including `amino_types` modules. 
   All types are now `DomainType`s implementing Protobuf-encoding using Prost. 
   ([#504], [#535], [#536], [#585])

- `[tendermint]` Protocol breaking changes for compatibility with Tendermint Core v0.34 (and the Cosmos Stargate release) ([#305]):
    - Validators are now sorted by voting power (descending) 
    and address (ascending). ([#506])
    - Remove PubKey field from DuplicateVoteEvidence ([#502])
    - Fix hash of empty Merkle tree to comply with RFC6962 ([#498])
    - All binary encoding is done via protobuf3 instead of amino 
   ([#504], [#535], [#536], [#585])
    - Various updates to JSON encoding ([#505])

### FEATURES:

- `[light-client]` Introduce builder API for light client initialization
  ([#583])
- `[rpc]` The subscription client interface provides a structured `Query`
  mechanism to help ensure compile-time validity of subscription queries. ([#584])
- `[rpc]` Support unsubscribing from events ([#516])
  mechanism to help ensure compile-time validity of subscription queries. ([#584])
- `[spec]` TLA+ for the Tendermint consensus algorithm including proof
  forks can only be caused by +1/3 Byzantine validators
  committing equivocation or amnesia attacks. ([#496])
- `[spec]` English spec of light client attacks and evidence required to
  correctly handle them ([#526])
- `[tendermint]` Implement `fmt::UpperHex` for `Transaction` ([#613])
- `[testgen]` Various features and improvements to support model-based testing with 
    the [Apalache model checker] ([#414])

### IMPROVEMENTS:

- [`light-client]` Start using model-based testing to test Light Client
  executions against traces emitted from the TLA+ model ([#414])
- `[rpc]` A `WebSocketClient` is now provided to facilitate event
  subscription for a limited range of RPC events over a WebSocket connection.
  See the [Tendermint `/subscribe` endpoint's](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/#/Websocket/subscribe)
  and the `tendermint-rpc` crate's docs for more details.
  To access this struct you need to enable both the `client`, `subscription`
  and `transport_websocket` features when using the `tendermint-rpc` crate.
  ([#516])
- `[rpc]` The subscription client interface provides a structured `Query`
  mechanism to help ensure compile-time validity of subscription queries.
  See the crate docs and [#584] for details.
- `[rpc]` The RPC request and response types' fields are now all publicly
  accessible ([#636]).

- `[tendermint | rpc | light-client]` Crates now compile to WASM on the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasm32-wasi` targets ([#463])
- Dependency updates: 
    - Update sled to 0.34 ([#490])
    - Update k256 to v0.5 ([#578])
    - Remove tai64 crate  ([#603])

### BUG FIXES:

- `[rpc]` Correctly handles control and keep-alive messages ([#516], [#590])
- `[rpc]` More robust handling of concurrency issues ([#311], [#313])

## v0.16.0

*Aug 31, 2020*

This release is the first release of the [testgen][testgen-dir] utility, 
a generator for Tendermint types for unit and integration tests and for model-based testing. 
It is a utility for producing tendermint datastructures from minimal input, targeted for testing.

The release also contains various Rust API-breaking changes. It remains compatible with v0.33 of Tendermint Core.

 ⚠️ ️Deprecation warning ⚠️ : The `lite` module was removed. Please take a look at the [light-client][light-client-dir] crate.

### BREAKING CHANGES:

- [repo] CHANGES.md renamed to CHANGELOG.md
- [tendermint] Eliminate use of `signatory` wrapper crate in favour of underlying `ed25519-dalek` and `k256` crates. `ed25519-dalek` is now v1.0 and `k256` provides a pure Rust implementation of secp256k1 rather than wrapping the C library ([#522])
- [tendermint] Remove `lite` and `lite_impl` modules. See the new `light-client`
  crate ([#500])

### FEATURES:

- [tendermint/proto] A tendermint-proto crate was created that contains the Rust structs for protobuf,
preparing for compatibility with Tendermint Core v0.34 ([#508])
- [tendermint/proto-compiler] A tendermint-proto-compiler crate was created that generates the tendermint-proto structs from the Tendermint Core Protobuf definitions.
- [testgen] Introduce the `testgen` crate for generating Tendermint types from
  minimal input ([#468])

### IMPROVEMENTS:

- [light-client] Use the `testgen` for generating tests
- [light-client] Use primary error as context of `NoWitnessLeft` error ([#477])
- [repo] Various improvements to documentation and crate structure
- [repo] Add CONTRIBUTING.md document ([#470])
- [specs] Updates to fork detection English spec for evidence handling in
  Tendermint and IBC ([#479])
- [specs] Model checking results and updates for the fast sync TLA+ spec ([#466])

### BUG FIXES:

- [light-client] Fix to reject headers from the future ([#474])

## v0.15.0

*July 17, 2020*

This release is the first official release of the revamped [light-client][light-client-dir] library and the [light-node][light-node-dir] command-line interface.
Together they provide a complete Tendermint light client implementation that performs squential and skipping verification
and attempts to detect forks across its peers. Complete TLA+ specifications for light client verification are included,
along with work-in-progress specs for fork detection. The implementation is compatible with v0.33 of Tendermint Core.

Note that both the [light-client][light-client-dir]  and [light-node][light-node-dir] crates are to be considered experimental software that will still undergo a 
lot of improvements and iterations. The goal of releasing an early version of our Light Client is to make it accessible, to get people use it, and to receive feedback.

An overview of the current design of the light client is provided in [ADR-006]
and [ADR-007].


 ⚠️ ️Deprecation warning ⚠️ : This might be the last release containing the [lite][lite-dir] module. Please take a look at the [light-client][light-client-dir] crate.

### BREAKING CHANGES:

- [repo] make secp256k1 dependency optional ([#441])

### FEATURES:

- [light-client] Rewrite and expansion of `lite`, the prior light client
  verification module, into a new fully-featured `light-client` crate. The crate provides a db, 
  functions for complete light client verification, peer management, fork detection, and evidence reporting,
  along with extensive testing. Components are composed via a `Supervisor`, which is run in its own thread, 
  and exposes a Handle trait to broker access to underlying state and
  functionality. See the [light-client][light-client-dir] crate for details.
- [light-node] New binary crate with CLI for running the light client as a daemon,
  complete with an rpc server for querying the latest state of the light node
  while it syncs with the blockchain. See the [light-node][light-node-dir] crate
  for details.

### BUG FIXES:

- [tendermint/validator] Sort validators by address on deserialization ([#410])
- [tendermint/validator] Fix deserializing Update struct when power field is 0
  ([#451])
- [tendermint/abci] Fix DeliverTx response deserialization issues with
  gasWanted, gasUsed, and data fields ([#432])
- [tendermint/lite_impl] Fix header.hash for height 1 ([#438])
